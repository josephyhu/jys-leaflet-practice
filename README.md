# JY's Leaflet Practice

## Features (so far)
1. Enter a location's street address, city, and state to zoom in to that location and place a marker there with the location's full address and its coordinates displayed on a tooltip.
2. Click anywhere on the map to place a market at that point; hover over the marker to show the location's full address and its coordinates on a tooltip. Click on two or more different areas on the map to join markers with a polyline.
